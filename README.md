A design-driven Senior Front End Developer with over 10 years of experience in the software industry. Specializing in Javascript and Vue.js, I have a passion for crafting seamless user experiences.

Formerly with JumpCloud, I contributed to building their internal design system and component framework, Stratus. Prior to that, at Status Controls, I led a team in developing a white-label Vue application utilized by prominent companies like Nike, Netflix, and Climate Pledge Arena, as well as individual users for their home and building automation needs.

Based in the heart of the Pacific Northwest, I thrive on collaborating with distributed teams to bring innovative solutions to life.
